🔍 Step-by-step

1. Open src/index.ts
→ See where middleware is added
→ Which order? Middleware order matters.

2. Open src/routes.ts
→ See which middleware runs on which route
→ Are some routes public, some protected?

3. Inspect src/middleware/*
→ Read each file
→ Ask: What properties does each add to req or res?

4. Look at controllers
→ These are your final handlers
→ How do they expect req.user, req.body, etc.?

5. Check tests
→ Tests tell you what behavior is expected



🧠 What to Focus On for Maximum Learning
📌 Order of middleware

Middleware is invoked in the sequence you register it. This affects output.
📌 Request object evolution

Track how req changes:

req.method, req.url
  ↓
req.headers
  ↓
req.body (after parser)
  ↓
req.user (after auth)

📌 Error propagation

How does middleware signal errors?
Try making requests that fail validation.
📌 Route protection

Which endpoints require auth?
How are protected routes configured?
